                        Hi! Robin here. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Let me share a bit about myself.<br/>
                        A while ago I used to fix cars for a living.<br/>
                        Nowadays I am a Javascript fanboy who loves tinkering in frontend code.<br/>
                        Some technologies which I am passionate about are react, react-native, threejs and deno.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        For the past 2,5 years I have been working at Tracefy, a late stage startup focussing on gps solutions and preventing e-bike theft.<br/>
                        Because we had a small team I had a wide variety of responsibilities.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-4 mt-2">
                            <li>Creating web applications</li>
                            <li>Creating small backend services</li>
                            <li>Designing new features</li>
                            <li>Helping to design the new micro-architecture landscape</li>
                            <li>Drawing out our existing micro-architecture to create stability</li>
                            <li>Designing the new mobile app.</li>
                            <li>Leading the development of the new mobile app along with two external developers</li>
                            <li>Teaching react and react-native to interns and external developers</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        If you wish to see some of my past projects head over to my work.<br/>
                        <br/>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
