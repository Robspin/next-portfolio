                        Hi! Robin here. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Let me share a bit about myself.<br/>
                        A while ago I used to fix cars for a living.<br/>
                        Now I am a Javascript fanboy who loves tinkering in frontend code.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        For the past 2,5 years I have been working at Tracefy, a late stage startup focussing on gps solutions and preventing e-bike theft.<br/>
                        Because we had a small team I had a wide variety of responsibilities.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>
                        - Creating web applications<br/>
                        - Creating small backend services<br/>
                        - Designing new features<br/>
                        - Helping to design the new micro-architecture landscape<br/>
                        - Drawing out our existing micro-architecture to create stability<br/>
                        - Designing the new Tracefy app.<br/>
                        - Building the new Tracefy app leading a team with two external developers<br/>
                        - Teaching react and react-native to interns and external developers<br/>
                        <br/>
                        The last few years where quite the ride to say the least.<br/>
                        <br/>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
