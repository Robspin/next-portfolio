                        Hi! Robin here. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Let me share a bit about myself.<br/>
                        A while ago I used to fix cars for a living.<br/>
                        Now I am a Javascript fanboy who loves tinkering in frontend code.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        I enjoyed working at Tracefy for over 2,5 years, a late stage startup company focussing on gps solutions and preventing bicycle theft.<br/>
                        Because we had a small team I had a wide variety of responsibilities.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>
                        - Creating web applications (mostly with react)<br/>
                        - Creating small backend services<br/>
                        - Designing new features<br/>
                        - Helped designing the new micro-architecture landscape<br/>
                        - Drawed out our existing micro-architecture to create stability<br/>
                        - Designed the new Tracefy app.<br/>
                        - Built the new Tracefy app leading a team with two external developers<br/>
                        <br/>
                        The last few years where quite the ride.<br/>
                        <br/>
