                        Hi! Robin here. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Let me share a bit about myself.<br/>
                        Before I was a Javascript fanboy I used to fix cars for a living.<br/>
                        But after reaching a ceiling and not seeing a future for myself in the car industry I
                        quit.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        I traveled for some time and ended up living in Japan for a while and studied Japanese.<br/>
                        Figured that if I could learn Japanese I could probably also learn to code.<br/>
                        That's where my coding journey started! <br/>
                        <br/>
                        After learning myself the basics of web development I focussed on react. <br/>
                        Started freelancing and building a portfolio.<br/>
                        Then after a while I got hired by Tracefy a late stage startup in creating anti-theft
                        tracking solutions for e-Bikes.<br/>
                        Where I am still working to this day. <br/>
                        <br/>
